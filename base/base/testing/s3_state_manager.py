    This module is designed for the automated loading of data into multiple simulated S3 buckets,
    facilitating the replication of a file structure within S3.


    To initiate the loader, two paths need to be provided: one containing state files (state_folder_path)
    and another containing the content to be stored in S3 (file_content_path).

    THE STATE_FILE:
    The state file is a JSON file comprising a list of MockS3File instances.
    Each MockS3File represents a file in S3. For each file, the loader searches for the corresponding file name
    (based on the s3_file) in the file_content_path. If the file exists, it is loaded to S3;
    if not, a mock file with the same key is uploaded.

    Additionally, the date_modified can be customized in the state file.
    If it is not specified, the modified_date will be set to the current day.
